Hi and welcome to my Github! 
I'm Marc 👀, a physicist 👨🏻‍🏫 with a passion for Data Science and coding👨🏻‍💻. My coding languages of choice are Python and GoLang, and I'm currently diving into the world of R—because statistics truly do matter. I can also speak Fortran!


Presently, I'm at the forefront of data at a leading Data-Driven Digital Marketing firm, Company[^1]. My core responsibilities include data development and management. With the surge in data we're handling, I was brought on board to streamline and optimize our data warehousing processes. I also enjoy crafting applications that enhance efficiency for my colleagues.

Parallel to my professional journey, I'm pursuing a [Master's degree in Data Science](https://estudis.uoc.edu/ca/graus/data-science/presentacio). This program is refining my understanding of data modeling, mining, and handling large datasets—tools I foresee as invaluable in my career. While I value structured learning, I also recognize Google as my ever-reliable mentor. Recently, AI chatbots have also joined the ranks.

Though my GitHub isn't a regular showcase of my work (due to company specifics), you'll find select projects from my university (subject to permission) and a Bootcamp I attended. There might also be snippets of code crafted for diverse needs. If anything piques your interest or if you have queries, please feel free to connect. I'm always eager to engage with fellow tech enthusiasts.

```python
s = "Python syntax highlighting"
print s
```
Here is a simple footnote[^1].

A footnote can also have multiple lines[^2].  

You can also use words, to fit your writing style more closely[^note].

[^1]: My reference.
[^2]: Every new line should be prefixed with 2 spaces.  
  This allows you to have a footnote with multiple lines.
[^note]:
    Named footnotes will still render with numbers instead of the text but allow easier identification and linking.  
    This footnote also has been made with a different syntax using 4 spaces for new lines.
