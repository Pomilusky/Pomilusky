Hi and welcome to my Github! 
My name is Marc and I am a phycisist interested in DataScience and developing code! ðŸ‘€ 
I can speak python and fortran. I am currently learning a little bit of R as well, because stadistics matter.

Right now I am working in a Data Driven Digital Marketing Company[^1], my main roles are developing and helping with dealing with data, we are starting to have quite a lot of data to warehouse and process! I was hired to help in this matter. I also like developing little applications that make my collegues work a little more easy and fast. 

Currently I am also studying a masters degree on [Data Science](https://estudis.uoc.edu/ca/graus/data-science/presentacio), trying to understand a little better how to deal with big amounts of data, how modeling works, data minning, and many more things that I might need in a close future, improving my skills is something I like to work with, and guided study is a fast way to learn! Even though my main master has always been google, and now the AI chats are also getting there. 

I am not using GitHub to publish my work very often, as most of it has to do with very specific needs in my company, but if you have any questions or wanna now a little further don't hesitate to reach me! I will just try publish some of my University projects if they allow it! Among my repositories you are gonna find projects from a Bootcamp I did and probably some random code I have written for random purposes.

```python
s = "Python syntax highlighting"
print s
```
Here is a simple footnote[^1].

A footnote can also have multiple lines[^2].  

You can also use words, to fit your writing style more closely[^note].

[^1]: My reference.
[^2]: Every new line should be prefixed with 2 spaces.  
  This allows you to have a footnote with multiple lines.
[^note]:
    Named footnotes will still render with numbers instead of the text but allow easier identification and linking.  
    This footnote also has been made with a different syntax using 4 spaces for new lines.
